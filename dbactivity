Online Datafile Movement for Archival Database – High-to-Low Performance Disk Segregation

Description

Performed online movement of datafiles in the Archival Database as per bank compliance requirements. The policy mandates storing the latest three months of data on high-performance disks and migrating older data to low-performance disks. The activity is conducted monthly, moving datafiles from ARCHDATA to EISDATA diskgroups for tablespaces storing data older than three months.

Reason / Purpose

Comply with bank’s storage policy for cost optimization and performance segregation.

Maintain high-performance access for recent data while optimizing storage costs for older data.

Ensure archival database storage tiers are utilized efficiently.


Steps Performed

1. Identified tablespaces containing data older than three months.


2. Selected eligible datafiles for migration based on last modification date and size.


3. Executed ALTER DATABASE MOVE DATAFILE command online to move datafiles from ARCHDATA to EISDATA diskgroup.


4. Monitored movement duration (average 3–4 minutes per file) and performance impact.


5. Verified file location updates in DBA_DATA_FILES.


6. Repeated activity monthly to maintain ongoing compliance.



Risks and Mitigation

Challenge: Risk of impacting performance during movement.
Mitigation: Scheduled migration during low-load windows; moved files sequentially.

Challenge: Large volume of files (3500+ total moved to date).
Mitigation: Automated file selection scripts to reduce manual effort.

Challenge: Potential space shortage in target diskgroup during peak archival loads.
Mitigation: Pre-migration space validation and alerts.


Advantages / Benefits

Maintains compliance with bank’s performance-tier storage policy.

Optimizes use of high-performance disks for recent operational queries.

Reduces storage costs by using lower-tier disks for older data.

Activity is performed online with minimal disruption to users.


Outcome / Result

Successfully moved ~3500 datafiles from ARCHDATA to EISDATA diskgroup to date.

Continuous monthly process ensures adherence to retention and storage policies.

Achieved performance balance and cost savings without affecting availability.

Post-Archiving Table Compression in Archival Database using HCC

Description

Due to Oracle GoldenGate’s lack of support for data compression at the target database, the archived tables in the Archival Database had the same size as the Production Database, leading to inefficient storage usage. To address this, we implemented post-archiving table compression in the Archival Database using the DBMS_PARALLEL_EXECUTE utility with Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC) to achieve optimal space savings.

Reason / Purpose

Reduce storage footprint in the Archival Database without impacting GoldenGate replication.

Improve storage utilization and reduce infrastructure costs.

Maintain data availability for queries while optimizing disk space usage.


Steps Performed

1. Identified large tables and partitions that had already been archived from Production to the Archival Database.


2. Selected one partition at a time for compression to minimize performance impact.


3. Used DBMS_PARALLEL_EXECUTE to parallelize the compression process for high-volume data.


4. Applied Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC) for maximum compression ratio.


5. Validated data integrity and index usability after compression.


6. Updated storage reports to track space savings achieved.



Risks and Mitigation

Challenge: Avoiding GoldenGate replication conflicts while compressing data.
Mitigation: Performed compression only after data was fully archived and replication stopped for that partition.

Challenge: Long compression times for large partitions.
Mitigation: Executed compression in parallel and off-peak hours.

Challenge: Maintaining query performance after HCC.
Mitigation: Applied compression only to older, less frequently queried data.


Advantages / Benefits

Significant storage savings: reduced ~170TB to ~50TB (1:4 compression ratio).

Optimized storage utilization for archival data without impacting OLTP workloads.

Reduced backup storage requirements and associated costs.

Process can be repeated regularly for newly archived data.


Outcome / Result

Completed compression for six large table partitions to date.

Achieved an average 1:4 compression ratio using HCC.

Freed over 120TB of storage, resulting in substantial cost and capacity benefits.

Established an ongoing monthly process for future archival partitions.
